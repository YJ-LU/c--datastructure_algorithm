# c--datastructure_algorithm
## DS &amp; ALGO code
>ALL involves C++.
>>Implement basic data structrue. For example, use linked list to build a queue, and use map to build a BST. And some advanced data structure like heap, avl trees, graphs.
>>Base on the algorithm design technic, implement sort algorithm, search algorithm, graph algorithm and so on. Research Big O of efficiency.
And include uploded LeetCode programming note.
